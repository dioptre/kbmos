## Output ##

**b\_output**

Output text to the screen (The string must be null-terminated)

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RSI = message location (zero-terminated string)
	OUT:	All registers preserved

Assembly Example:

	mov rsi, Message
	call b_output
	...
	Message: db 'This is a test', 0

C/C++ Example:

	char Message[] = "This is a test";
	b_output(Message);
	...
	b_output("This is a another test");


**b\_output\_chars**

Output a number of characters to the screen

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RSI = message location
			RCX = number of characters to output
	OUT:	All registers preserved

Assembly Example:

	mov rsi, Message
	mov rcx, 4
	call os_output_chars					; Only output the word 'This'
	...
	Message: db 'This is a test', 0

C/C++ Example:

	b_output_chars("This is a test", 4);	// Output 'This'


## Input ##

**b\_input**

Accept a number of keys from the keyboard. The resulting string will automatically be null-terminated

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RDI = location where string will be stored
			RCX = number of characters to accept
	OUT:	RCX = length of string that were input (NULL not counted)
			All other registers preserved

Assembly Example:

	mov rdi, Input
	mov rcx, 20
	call b_input
	...
	Input: db 0 times 21

C/C++ Example:

	char Input[21];
	b_input(Input, 20);


**b\_input\_key**

Scans keyboard for input

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	Nothing
	OUT:	AL = 0 if no key pressed, otherwise ASCII code, other regs preserved
			All other registers preserved

Assembly Example:

	call b_input_key
	mov byte [KeyChar], al
	...
	KeyChar: db 0

C/C++ Example:

	char KeyChar;
	KeyChar = b_input_key


## SMP ##

**b\_smp\_enqueue**

Add a workload to the processing queue

**b\_smp\_dequeue**

Dequeue a workload from the processing queue

**b\_smp\_run**

Call the code address stored in RAX

**b\_smp\_wait**

Wait until all other CPU Cores are finished processing


## Memory ##

**b\_mem\_allocate**

Allocate pages of memory

**b\_mem\_release**

Release pages of memory


## Network ##

**b\_ethernet\_tx**

Transmit data via Ethernet

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RSI = memory location of packet
			RCX = length of packet
	OUT:	All registers preserved

Assembly Example:

	mov rsi, Packet
	mov rcx, 1500
	call b_ethernet_tx
	...
	Packet:
	Packet_Dest: db 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF ; Broadcast
	Packet_Src: db 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
	Packet_Type: dw 0xABBA
	Packet_Data: db 'This is a test', 0

The packet must contain a proper 14-byte header.

**b\_ethernet\_rx**

Receive data via Ethernet

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RDI = memory location to store packet
	OUT:	RCX = length of packet, 0 if nothing to receive

Assembly Example:

	mov rdi, Packet
	call b_ethernet_rx
	...
	Packet: times 1518 db 0

Notes: BareMetal OS does not keep a buffer of received packets. This means that the OS will overwrite the last packet received as soon as it receives a new one. You can continuously poll the network by checking b_ethernet_rx often, but this is not ideal. BareMetal OS allows for a network interrupt callback handler to be run whenever a packet is received. With a callback, your program will always be aware of when a packet was received. Check programs/ethtool.asm for an example of using a callback.

## File ##

**b\_file\_open**

Open a file

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RSI = File name (zero-terminated string)
	OUT:	RAX = File I/O handler number, 0 on error
			All other registers preserved

Assembly Example:

	mov rsi, Filename
	call b_file_open
	mov [Filenumber], rax
	...
	Filename: db 'test.txt', 0
	Filenumber: dq 0


**b\_file\_close**

Close a file

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RAX = File I/O handler number
	OUT:	All registers preserved

Assembly Example:

	mov rax, [Filenumber]
	call b_file_close

**b\_file\_read**

Read a number of bytes from a file to memory

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RAX = File I/O handler number
			RCX = Number of bytes to read
			RDI = Destination memory address
	OUT:	RCX = Number of bytes read
			All other registers preserved

**b\_file\_write**

Write a number of bytes from memory to a file

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RAX = File I/O handler number
			RCX = Number of bytes to write
			RSI = Source memory address
	OUT:	RCX = Number of bytes written
			All other registers preserved

**b\_file\_seek**

Seek to a specific part of a file

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RAX = File I/O handler number
			RCX = Number of bytes to offset from origin.
			RDX = Origin
	OUT:	All registers preserved

**b\_file\_query**

Query the existence of a file

**b\_file\_create**

Create a file on disk

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RCX = Number of bytes to reserve
			RSI = File name (zero-terminated string)
	OUT:	All registers preserved

**b\_file\_delete**

Delete a file from disk

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RSI = File name (zero-terminated string)
	OUT:	All registers preserved


## Misc ##

**b\_system\_config**

View or modify system configuration options

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RDX = Function #
			RAX = Variable 1
	OUT:	RAX = Result 1

Function numbers come in pairs (one for reading a parameter, and one for writing a parameter). b_system_config should be called with a function alias and not a direct function number.

**b\_system\_misc**

Call miscellaneous OS sub-functions

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RDX = Function #
			RAX = Variable 1
			RCX = Variable 2 
	OUT:	RAX = Result 1
			RCX = Result 2
